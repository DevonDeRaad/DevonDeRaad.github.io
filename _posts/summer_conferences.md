This summer I was selected as a finalist for the 2025 SSE Hamilton Award and the 2025 SSB Mayr Award. Because of this, I got to present my talk in the Hamilton Symposium at the virtual Evolution conference in May 2025, alongside other excellent talks from early career researchers on their respective dissertation projects. It was an honor to be chosen to participate in this symposium.

Later in the summer (August 2025) I also presented this work at the American Ornithological Society meeting in St. Louis. This conference was a great opportunity to catch up with friends and colleagues and see what type of exciting work is being done across ornithology!
