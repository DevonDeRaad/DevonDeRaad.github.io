I am an evolutionary biologist with a background in museum ornithology. I am passionate about understanding evolution on a granular level, therefore my research projects document and synthesize patterns of biodiversity in wild bird populations, with the goal of revealing the key evolutionary mechanisms controlling global biodiversity accumulation.

I am currently a La Kretz Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California Los Angeles, working in the [Aguillon Lab](https://stepfanieaguillon.com/). My postdoctoral research focuses on revealing the key evolutionary mechanisms involved in speciation and diversification in a variety of bird systems across North America.

I am passionate about reproducibility and accessibility in science, and I do my best to make my [published work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cfjhgJAAAAAJ&hl=en) fully reproducible through [associated GitHub repositories](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad).

I am currently on the academic job market, looking for opportunities to start my own research lab focused on answering exciting questions in evolutionary biology by using cutting edge genomic approaches to study wild bird populations across the globe.
