I am an evolutionary biologist with a background in museum ornithology. I'm currently searching for positions that would allow me to run my own lab focused on answering exciting questions in evolutionary biology by studying wild bird populations across the globe.

I am currently a La Kretz Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California Los Angeles, where I am working in the [Aguillon Lab](https://stepfanieaguillon.com/). My postdoc research focuses on studying speciation and diversification in a variety of bird systems across North America.

I recently earned my PhD from the University of Kansas, where I worked in the [Moyle Lab](https://moyle4.wixsite.com/moyle-lab), located in the KU Natural History Museum. My doctoral research focused on revealing the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that have generated modern patterns of biodiversity in birds of the Pacific Islands.

I first became interested in evolutionary biology while earning my Bachelors of Science at Occidental College, where I worked with the avian specimen collection in the [Moore Laboratory of Zoology](https://moorelab.oxy.edu/).
