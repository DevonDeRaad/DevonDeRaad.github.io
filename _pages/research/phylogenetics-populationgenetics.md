Much of my dissertation work focused on reconstructing the speciation process in birds that live in Oceania, inhabiting complex, fragmented island chains. These distributions make it challenging to understand species boundaries, because these boundaries are rarely tested via secondary contact, as they often are in broadly distributed continental taxa. Therefore, island bird lineages frequently exist in a murky gray area between population-level and
