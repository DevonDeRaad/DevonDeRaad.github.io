title: "What can human translocations reveal about how natural populations colonize and establish in novel localities?"
---

A unique and exciting way to study the process of diversification under natural conditions is to leverage human translocations. I am in the process of developing two systems where birds were translocated to southern California via the pet trade and subsequently founded wild populations. These recently established populations can offer natural experiments, where we can watch the process of a population colonizing and establishing a new locality in real time.
