title: "Human translocations allow us to study the diversification process in real time"
---

I also leverage human translocations as a unique and exciting way to study the process of diversification under natural conditions. I am currently developing two systems where birds were translocated via the pet trade and subsequently founded wild populations in southern California. These are the *Zosterops* white-eyes and the *Amazona* parrots. These recently established populations can offer natural experiments, where we can watch the process of a population colonizing and establishing a new locality in real time. 

## Using genomics to reconstruct the introduction of *Zosterops* white-eyes in the USA
- open access link to the manuscript: [On the brink of explosion? Identifying the source and potential spread of introduced *Zosterops* white-eyes in North America](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-024-03268-8).  
Already, I have published an investigation demonstrating that the white-eyes introduced in Hawaii and Southern California are different species, derived from completely separate introduction events. Further, the birds in Hawaii show no superficial signatures of a genetic bottleneck, while the birds in Southern California appear to have experienced a genetic bottleneck.

Future projects will focus on investigating how, despite very different introduction scenarios, both of these populations appear to be thriving.
