Alongside my empirical work, I am interested in the development of rigorous and user-friendly software for evolutionary genomics. I strongly believe that in this highly specialized and technical era of scientific progress, the demystification of challenging technical concepts, with the goal of training a next generation of diverse scientists, is the only way we will continue to generate scientific breakthroughs. To that end I actively participate in the development of open-source software and training materials, so that motivated investigators from any background can embark on the crucial journey of deeply understanding the processing pipelines and statistical decisions involved in generating evolutionary insights from genomic data.

### SNPfiltR
As part of my empirical work on the genomics of wild bird populations undertaken during my PhD, I identified a gap in available pipelines for analyzing next-generation sequence data (i.e., Illumina short-read sequences mapped to a reference genome). Specifically, there was no available software designed to filter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets in an interactive way with built-in visualization tools. This typically resulted in users falling back on previously published sets of "standard filters", rather than optimizing filtering parameters based on the idiosyncracies of their specific dataset. To address this gap I developed the R package SNPfiltR, which is designed to visualize key parameters such as genotype quality and missing data proportion, allowing users to quickly and interactively design an optimized set of filtering parameters for their SNP dataset, without the hassle and potential introduction of mistakes associated with designing unique, homebrewed visualization and filtering scripts for each SNP dataset. A [manuscript](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13618) announcing the package was published in Molecular Ecology Resources and the package is freely available for download via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SNPfiltR/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/SNPfiltR). The package website [https://devonderaad.github.io/SNPfiltR/](https://devonderaad.github.io/SNPfiltR/) contains detailed tutorial-style vignette walkthroughs demonstrating the filtering process for real empirical datasets.
