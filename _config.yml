# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I want to understand the evolutionary forces mediating the generation of novel biodiversity across the globe.
  To achieve this goal, I use wild (both natural and human-introduced) bird populations as natural experiments.
  My research is at the forefront of the effort to integrate specimen-vouchered museum samples with cutting-edge genomic approaches to answer exciting questions in evolutionary biology.
